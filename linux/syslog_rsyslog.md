# config

* https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/configuration/index.html

the *rsyslog* format is based on the standard *syslog.conf* format. As *rsyslog* has a lot more advanced features than *sysklogd*, it extends this format with special configuration directives which all start with the **$** **prefix**.

```sh
sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.conf # globale Konfigurationsdatei
ll /etc/rsyslog.d/ # loggin rules; all files here with a .conf extension are read by rsyslog
sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf # default logging rules
```
