# sftp

**SSH secure file transfer protocol**

SFTP is more or less a direct successor to SCP. The data transfer is encrypted and uses existing SSH infrastructure. In practice this means that hostsâ€™ remote file systems can be accessed with STFP if SSH access is allowed from the local system. The SFTP protocol offers a **significantly broader range of features than SCP**. Transferred data is automatically checked for correctness and interrupted transfers can be resumed.
