# ulimit

**get and set user limits**; [shell builtin]

getrlimit, setrlimit; sysconf

* a **hard limit** cannot be increased by a non-root user once it is set
* a **soft limit** may be increased up to the value of the hard limit; 

If neither `-H` nor `-S` is specified, both the soft and hard limits are set; The **value of limit** can be a number in the unit specified for the resource or one of the special values hard, soft, or unlimited, which stand for the current hard limit, the current soft limit, and no limit, respectively.

```sh
ulimit [-HS] <options> <limit>
ulimit -a # shows all current limits
ulimit [-H|S] -c <limit> # core files in [blocks]
ulimit [-H|S] -d <limit> # data segment size of a process in [kbytes]
ulimit [-H|S] -e <limit> # scheduling priority (*nice*) [-20, 19]
ulimit [-H|S] -u <limit> # number of processes available to a single user [nr.]
ulimit [-H|S] -v <limit> # amount of virtual memory available to the shell and, on some systems, to ist children
```

```sh
# Konfiguration
/etc/profile # 
/etc/security/limits.conf
```

## recomendations

```sh
*			soft	core 	0 # Prevent corefiles from being generated by default
* 		hard	core 	unlimited # Allow corefiles to be temporarily enabled
*			hard	nproc	2048 # Prevent fork-bombs from taking out the system
root	hard	nproc 65536 # Prevent root from not being able to launch enough processes
```

- **core**: Corefiles are useful for debugging, but annoying when normally using your system.  
- **nice**: You should disallow everyone except for root from having processes of minimal niceness (-20), so that root can fix an unresponsive system.
- **nproc**: Having an nproc limit is important, because this will limit how many times a fork-bomb can replicate. However, having it too low can make your system unstable or even unusable, as new processes will not be able to be created.
