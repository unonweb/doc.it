# FileReader

The FileReader object lets web applications asynchronously read the contents of files (or raw data buffers) stored on the user's computer, using File or Blob objects to specify the file or data to read.

* can only access the contents of files that the user has explicitly selected, either using an HTML `<input type="file">` element or by drag and drop.
