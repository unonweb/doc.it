* **Flyout Navigation**

  Any page menu that visually generates submenus, objects, or links when website users hover their mouse over them.

* **Dropdown** 

  Is like a `select` element.  On clicking or hovering over the element, its child elements are animated and  exposed down below it.  They just 'drop down' after click or hover. The  difference between popover and dropdown in most cases is that dropdown  has child elements.

* **Dropline Menus**

  Dropline Menus ask you to mouse over or clicking the main menu item.  When you do, a line appear below the main menu with additional choices.  One is illustrated in the image below.

# Design Rules

## Color

### 60-30-10

It's a classic decor rule that helps create a color palette for a space. 

* **60%** of the room should be a **dominant color**
* **30%** should be the **secondary color or texture** 
* **10%** should be an **accent**

The 60% is the overall color of the room, the background color if you will. When you look at the space you'll say, it's the "gray" room, or whatever color you choose.

The next number in this rule is your 30%. It will become the secondary color in your space and will support the main color, but be different enough to give the room interest. Think of it this way, you'll be using half as much of this color as you did for your main color.

The fun percentage is your 10%; your accent color. It can be more bold or more subtle depending on what look you want. The 10% can be what gives the room character or keeps it that much more neutral, it's really up to you.

#### Monochromatic

Choose only ONE color and use lighter and darker variations of that color in your space. This works best with a neutral color such as gray, cream, white, or greige.

#### Complimentary

Select TWO colors opposite from each other on the color wheel. One will always end up being a "warm" color and the other will be a "cool" color giving you a nice balance.

#### Analogous

Select THREE colors adjacent (next) to each other on the color wheel, having the middle color being the more dominant color. An example of this would be blue-green, green, and green-yellow; do you see how green is showing up in all three? Ahh, yes!

#### Split Complimentary

Similar to *Complimentary* (listed above) but you add in a third color. So you select a main color, find it's complimentary color across from it on the color wheel, and add in one of the colors adjacent (next) to the complimentary color. An example might be, Blue as your dominant color, then orange as your complimentary color and red as the third color.

#### Can I Break the 60-30-10 Rule?

Yes, if you're feeling confident and rebellious, BUT know that you're going to complicate things a little bit. You have three options with this:

1. **Score 110%**
   - Add a fourth color to the mix by doing something like 60-30-10-10. This will be done by adding a second accent color in your accessories such as throw pillows, vases on shelves, picture frames, etc.
2. **Go Completely Monochromatic**
   - Select ONE color and go wild and crazy from there by including several darker and lighter shades of that same color throughout your space. This can be done with wood tones as well. You may end up with an entirely gray room, but it will have dimension because of the variation of tones you use.
3. **Create Your Own Formula**
   - I always talk about Interior Styling and Home Decor being about how the space makes you feel. If you are feeling like you have an idea for colors, go with it! It may end up being something like 40-30-20-10 or 40-25-15-10-10 or even 75-15-10. Whatever the case, just make sure you hone in on your percentages, otherwise it may look wild and crazy!
