`vite dev` and `vite serve` are aliases for `vite`

```sh
vite # starts the dev server using the current working directory as root
vite --config my-config.js some/sub/dir 
```

When running `vite` from the command line, Vite will automatically try to resolve a config file named `vite.config.js` inside project root
