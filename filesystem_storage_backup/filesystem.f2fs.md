# F2FS

Developed by Samsung specifically for a new class of data storage: NAND (NAND is what people mean when they refer to “flash memory”)

The Flash-Friendly File System (F2FS) is a file system intended for  NAND-based storage devices on Linux and other operating systems that  support it.

F2FS only focuses on flash memory, so it has dozens of optimizations  for SSDs on Linux. However, many Linux users shy away from it as not  every Linux distribution supports it in their installation tool.

advantages

- F2FS is explicitly designed for SSDs and other flash storage devices, so your OS will run efficiently and fast.
- F2FS is modern and relatively new, so it will most likely get new features as time goes on.

disadvantages

- F2FS is a very new file system. While it’s true that lots of Linux  distributions are starting to support it, it can’t be said that every  single Linux OS out there makes it easy to install.
