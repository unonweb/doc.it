# TELTONIKA

Teltonika's original product line, beginning in 2019, is the RUT series of routers, with many variations and models. These models we  consider to be outdated but still widely available and sometimes used in other gear:

- RUT 200 Series: Cat-4 single SIM router with 2.4GHz Wi-Fi and 2x Ethernet ports
- RUT 900 Series: Cat-4 dual SIM version with 2.4GHz Wi-Fi and 4x Ethernet ports

Starting in 2020, Teltonika came out with a new line of routers  called the RUTX line, again with many variations and models. These  newer routers feature more advanced processors and memory for better  performance and throughput, Gigabit Ethernet instead of FAST Ethernet,  and dual-band Wi-Fi (Wi-Fi 5 standard). Additionally, these newer  routers come with better modem options up to Cat-12.

- RUTX11: Cat-6 dual-SIM router with dual-band Wi-Fi 5 and 4x Gigabit Ethernet ports
- RUTX12: Dual Cat-6 Modems (1x SIM slot each) with dual-band Wi-Fi 5 and 5x Gigabit Ethernet ports
